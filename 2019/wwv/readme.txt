           Indices of Equatorial Pacific Heat Content

As indices of upper ocean heat content in the equatorial Pacific, 
we compute monthly Warm Water Volume (WWV) and depth averaged 
temperature over the upper 300 m (T300) from the ocean analyses 
of the Bureau National Operations Centre (BNOC) at the Australian 
Bureau of Meteorology. The data are based on temperature profiles 
from TAO moorings, Argo floats and XBTs. The temperature analyses 
are available at

The monthly WWV and T300 indices are computed for the period beginning 
January 1980. WWV is defined as the volume of water with temperature 
above 20°C in oceanic regions of the equatorial Pacific between 
5°N to 5°S, 120°E to 80°W. T300 is defined as the average temperature 
over the same latitude and longitude ranges. Monthly anomalies are 
computed by removing the mean seasonal cycle for a base period of 
1981-2010. Monthly means and anomalies for the eastern (80°W-155°W) 
and western (155°W-120°E) halves of the basin are also available, as 
are the mean seasonal cycles for the 1981-2010 base period. The two 
indices are equivalent for most purposes, with the correlation of 
monthly means and anomalies > 0.9.
